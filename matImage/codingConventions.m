%CODINGCONVENTIONS specify coding conventions for MALIMPA m-files
%
%   General:
%
%   This file specifies coding convention for future files. Some files may
%   not necessarily follows the requirements, as they were created before
%   conventions. 
%
%   Name of functions:
%
%   Java convention for file names must be used:
%   - Each function name must be written in lower case, using english
%       denomination.
%   - For compound function names, the first letter of each component after
%       the first one is capitalized.
%       Ex: 'distancePointPlane'.
%
%   Other convention should be used to avoid name conflicts:
%   - For function used as image filters, prefix 'im' may be used. Ex :
%       'imDirFilter'.
%   - For functions which work on a complex data type, the name of the data
%       type should be used as a prefix of the function name. 
%       Ex: functions working on polygons have a prototype on the form
%       'polygonLength', 'polygonArea'...
%   - Functions working with geometrical primitives can use a suffix for
%       indicating the dimension of application. 
%       Ex: 'distancePointLine3d'.
%       This convention was not used for the beginning of the library
%       development, but new functions will try to conform to it.
%
%   Function header:
%
%   - First line of documentation must contain the name of the function,
%   followed by a short description. Name and function may be separated by
%   colon. Name must be capitalized, without punctuation before
%   description (to remain valid with matlab documenbtation tools). 
%   Ex:   'SLICER Interactive visualization of 3D images'
%
%   - Main part of header describes usage of function/script with various
%   parameters. Function name should be the real name. Variables names
%   should be capitalized. This does not follow matlab's standard, but
%   allows to copy-paste pieces of code.
%   Ex: 'RES = myBasicFunction(PARAM1, PARAM2, OPTION);'
%
%   - The description of each calling syntax should be written using
%   conjugated verbs.
%   
%   - End of header should contain name of author, with date of creation.
%   It may also contains author affiliation (company ...), and date of last
%   revision.
%
%
%   Library Organization:
%
%   The principle is to gather functions which share a similar domain of
%   application. Ex: image processing filters, geometry functions...
%   It seems better to have one level of complexity for the directory
%   structure. 
%
%   However, it could be clearer to create specific subdirectories for
%   functions which operate on complex data (such as polygons, or special
%   types of curves). This allows to add a Contents file which describes
%   the model used by functions.
%
%
%   Function code:
%
%   - Please comment the code ! For algorithmic parts, as much comments as
%   code is a good start ...
%   - Indentation level should be marked by four space characters.
%
%
%   Tips & Tricks:
%
%   - The use of '...' at the end of a line can cause compatibility
%   problems from Linux to Windows.
%   - matlab help uses the file 'Contents.m', not 'contents.m' !
